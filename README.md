# finiteautomataproject

This is a project for the finite automata class. 
it allow you to determinize a non-deterministic finite automata, minimize it and check if a word is accepted by the automata.
it can also standardize the automata,complete it and give it's complement.

## How to use it

You just have to run the main.py file and follow the instructions.
there are 44 test files in the test folder, you can use them to test the program.

For each test file, We have save the result of the program in a folder with the same name as the test file.

## How to add an automaton

You can add an automaton by adding a file in the test folder.
The file must be a text file with the following format:

```
number of symbols
number of states
number of initial states - list of initial states
number of final states - list of final states
number of transitions 
transitions put like this : 
state1 + symbol + state2
```
